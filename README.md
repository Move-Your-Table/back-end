# MYT Back-end

## Description

The MYT Back-end handles all requested relating to desk, rooms & building information.

## Development Configuration
### Requirements
- [Docker (Desktop)](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [Node.JS LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) & NPM
### Getting started
1. Copy the `.env.example` file, rename it `.env` and configure it, as described in the [`.env` configuration section](#env-configuration)
2. Install the needed packages
   ```bash
   $ npm install
   ```
3. In the root of the directory, use the following command:
    ```bash
    $ npm run start:dev
    ```
âœ… Done! Your application should be configured & up and running. Start developing!
> ðŸš¨ **Note:** For some reason, Nest.JS takes a lot of time to recompile it's code within a docker container, so the development server will run your code locally. If you want to develop your code within a **fully containerized** environment, you can run the following command:
>
> ```
> $ npm run start:container:dev
> ```

## Available `start` commands
- **`npm run start:container:dev`**
    
    Start a fully **containerized** development server **with** hot-reloading capabilities.
- **`npm run start`**
  
  Start a development server without any hot-reloading capabilities, where **the app is runned locally**, but the needed containers are started.
- **`npm run start:dev`**
  
  Start a development server **with** hot-reloading capabilities, where **the app is runned locally**, but the needed containers are started.
- **`npm run start:prod`**
